# Health System Front-end
The initial idea is to create a landing page where the user can schedule a consultation with a doctor. </br>
Maybe in the future add some features like videocall for online medical consultation. </br>
The backend will be done in Java, you can follow the <a href="https://github.com/MatheusFelizardo/health-system-backend"> backend here </a> </br>
The main goal of this project is to practice Nuxt, svg usage, animations with GSAP, and the development of a fullstack application, from architecture to code.


## Next steps
- finish the landing page as <a target="_blank" href="https://www.figma.com/file/jMsoIw7qRK8dNTJ4hno5Kv/Trafalgar-Landing-Page-(Copy)?node-id=63%3A2677&mode=dev">layout base </a>
- add adjustments in mobile resolution
- add animations (see sugestions)
- add blog page layout (json file or notion api)

### Animations ideas
- Svg bullets blink one at a time
- Lightning border on waves svg
- Animations on scroll: Cards start white and rotate showing the content | scroll in the X and y for all contents


## Setup
### Install the dependencies:
```bash
yarn install
```
### Development Server
